 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The project is excuted as following:
• run_analysis.R
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
• Running the script:
1. Downloading the zipped URL file
2. Unzip the file
3. Save file in the directory.
4. Getting dataset to reaad: features activities and subjects.
5. Saving the clean data to a new file called (tidydataset.txt)
• Cleaned Data:
The resulting dataset is located in a repertory at: data/dataset.txt. It contains one row for each activity/subject and columns for activity and subject. And the original mean and standard deviation.
